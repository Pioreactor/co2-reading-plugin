## Pioreactor CO2 reading plugin

Adafruit offers three CO2 sensors ([SCD30](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4867), [SCD40 and SCD41](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-scd-40-and-scd-41)) that measure CO2, temperature, and humidity.

This is a simple Pioreactor plugin that returns CO2 readings (or all readings) at a set duration from stemma QT connected Adafruit SCD sensors.

## Installation instructions

Import and use the CO2Reading class to return a CO2 reading from the sensor.
